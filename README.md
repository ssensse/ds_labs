# training_projects

Here's my training projects sheet.

The most important project is [client_outflow](https://github.com/ssensse/training_projects/tree/main/client_outlow) ðŸ”¥

The other ones are most simple. They're for showing different instruments I can use. ðŸ”§

* [client_outflow](https://github.com/ssensse/training_projects/tree/main/client_outlow) - machine learning (binary classification) 
* [perspective_tariff](https://github.com/ssensse/training_projects/tree/main/perspective_tariff) - statistic analysis (t-test)
