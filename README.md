<h1>README file is under development...üîßüî®</h1>

Well, this repository will include my labs on Data Science. I didn't add many projects yet..

Here is short brief to my repository:
1. **Credit Score** lab. Here I used *statistic tests, linear regression, PCA and insane visualization.* The main purpose of this lab were practice on regression tasks.

2. **Tusya Recognition**. Tusya (–¢—É—Å—è) is my favorite toy. Although I don't have much knowledge to use deep learning algorithms, I tried to solve the problem of object recognition using classical ML methods (SVM + HOG). And I did it well :). I took about 100 pictures of my Tusya and 300 of other objects.

3. **Old labs**. Since the time I'd been working on them I developed my skills. I didn't know the statistic theory and ML well enough so I wouldn't call those projects as 'my proudest achievements'. That's why I hid them in a separate folder. But anyway you could see them if you're interested...

Someday I put here:
- More creative README.md :)
- More interesting projects
- A cat picture...

That's it.
