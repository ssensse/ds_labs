<h1>README file is under development...ðŸ”§ðŸ”¨</h1>

Well, this repository will include my labs on Data Science. I didn't add many projects yet..

Here are two folders for now:
1. **CreditScore** lab. Here I used *statistic tests, linear regression, PCA and insane visualization.* The main purpose of this lab were practice on regression tasks.

2. **Old labs**. During the time I've been working on them I've developed my skills. I didn't know the statistic theory and ML well enough so I wouldn't call those projects as 'my pride'. That's why I hid them in a separate folder. But anyway you could see them if you're interested...

3. Someday I put here:
   - More interesting projects
   - Versions of libraries.
   - A cat picture...

That's it.
