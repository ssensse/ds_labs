❓
There're two tariffs for clients: *Ultra* and *Smart*. Which one's better?
I have to do a statistic test to make decision about more profitable tariff for business.
We have two hypotheses:
1. The average receipt of users of the two tariffs differs.
2. The average receipt of users from Moscow differs from the rest.

Which tools did I used?

1. I used **pandas, numpy** for preprocessing and data preparation. 
2. **matplotlib** for EDA. I build histograms to compare tariffs and made some conclusions.
3. **stats** for statistic analysis. I tested two hypotheses by t-test.
